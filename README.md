# Pneumonia Detection Model Project

## Overview
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using advanced image processing techniques and deep learning, this project aims to provide a reliable diagnostic tool for healthcare professionals.

## Dataset
The dataset for training and evaluating our model can be found here:
[Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

This dataset includes a substantial collection of annotated chest X-ray images, labeled for the presence or absence of pneumonia, vital for training and validating our model.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing:** Utilizing OpenCV and other libraries for image preparation.
- **Deep Learning Model:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for image recognition tasks.
- **Accuracy Metrics:** Precision, recall, and F1-score for performance evaluation.
- **User Interface:** An easy interface for uploading X-ray images and receiving diagnostic predictions.
